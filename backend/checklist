1- Basic Server (Express setup with middleware).
2- Database Connection (MongoDB with Mongoose).
3- Routes and Controllers.
4- Authentication (Passport.js, JWT).
5- Email Service (Nodemailer).
6- API Documentation (Swagger).
7- Error Handling (Middleware to catch and format errors).

8. Input Validation and Sanitization
   Use libraries like Joi or Express-validator to validate and sanitize user input.

Helps prevent invalid data and enhances security by mitigating injection attacks.

9. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   Implement roles (e.g., Admin, User, Guest) for managing permissions.

Ensure certain routes/controllers are accessible only to authorized roles.

10. Logging and Monitoring
    Use a library like Winston or Morgan for logging server activity.

Consider integrating a monitoring tool like Sentry or LogRocket for error tracking in production.

11. Caching
    Use a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like itineraries or user profiles to improve performance.

12. Rate Limiting
    Implement rate limiting using express-rate-limit to protect your app from abuse or DDoS attacks.

13. Data Backup and Recovery
    Set up automated backups for your MongoDB database.

Use tools like MongoDB Atlas backup or manual backup scripts.

Optional Advanced Features
Search and Filtering
Enable advanced search and filtering for accommodations, activities, etc., using MongoDB aggregation pipelines or libraries like mongoose-fuzzy-searching.

WebSocket Integration
Use Socket.IO for real-time updates, like trip planning notifications for group trips.

Geolocation Features
Incorporate geospatial queries to find places near a user's location (e.g., restaurants within 5 km).

Payment Gateway Integration
Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for app monetization features like premium itineraries or subscriptions.

Data Analytics and Reporting
Create routes for analytics (e.g., user engagement, most popular destinations).

Use libraries like Chart.js or third-party tools for visualizations.
